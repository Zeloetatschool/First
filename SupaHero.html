This is a mostly true story written in a cinematic way, I did you a favor and put honest inserts in parathenses, Please enjoy, it took me a while to realize I can use my youtbue as person and even longer to make a semi-functional story out of it.


Hi, I'm Zeloet Gamer, Everyone's Favorite Youtuber (Not really D: ) I'm a RustV2 God (lies), leading legions of noobs (like 4) agianst the Dreaded MI6 Clan (40 Pay2win players), They struggled daily with bandits and raiders... until I came along, I brought hope back into the playerbase and restored peace for the most-part. My Youtube channel is my main power, sending anything from a random message to a hilarious rage to nearly 200 people at a time. People look up to me as the lowest man so they can feel better about thier every failure and fault. This is the hope I spread, futily attempting to create a peacekeeped sanctum for every alt account to absorb the delicious, hard earned resources of my crew and I worked our tail off for. I became a moblie charity, a hero in my own way, even if my methods are questionable, even if its mostly low quality and cringey videos, they still bring laughter and do nots to the viewers, and when ingame, make them feel like they have met thier idol, oftentimes bowing down and asking to be featured in something on the channel so they can be immortalized into internet on a small scale or maybe to brag to thier friends that they made it on at all, because of this I believe that I am a hero, maybe not the ideal hero and only kind of has a conflict but I still provide inspiration and entertianment. (Just like the comics!)

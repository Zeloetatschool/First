	<p>I'm not well known but I make my self known in the subtle of ways, I speak in whispers and glare from shade. What am I?</p>

	<p>How many times did I fail a class? ZERO, how many times did I cut it close? TOO MANY TIMES!  </p>

<p>I go by multipule names: Alex, Alexander, Aleks, Aleksander, Xander, Zeloet, and Allen. These are all names I go by online and a few of them in person.   </p>

<p>I'm a Gamer, a Youtuber, and A Minecraft Server Owner. My Servers can vary and change almost every other week, people should be caeful before they commit alot to it. I need help even though I doubt I'll admit it in person. </p>

<p>I try to play Villian lot, I make minecraft servers with evil twists and make scary/horror roleplays to terrify those whom I hang with. Everything I make has some sort of overlaying backstory often leading to me being the main antogonist. </p>
